# Signal Taxonomy

This is the catalog of evidence the pipeline looks for. A **signal** is one
observable fact about a company — pulled from an SEC filing or from web research —
that suggests it may need AI services. Each table row answers three questions:
what do we detect, how do we detect it, and why does it mean the company might buy.

Every signal carries evidence (URL + quote where possible) and a weight
(configurable in `config/settings.yaml` → `scoring.weights`). Signals feed four
scoring components: **intent**, **capability_gap**, **timing**, **commercial_fit**
(mapping in `src/pipeline/scoring.py` → `COMPONENT_OF`).

**Hard signals** (at least one required to qualify): E1, E3, E4, E5, P1, P2, P3.
Parallel-sourced hard signals (P1/P2/P3) satisfy the gate only when they carry
a source URL and substantive detail (≥40 chars) — web research earns hardness
with evidence; EDGAR signals are filing-derived and exempt
(`scoring.hard_types_present`).

## EDGAR signals (free — SEC filings via edgartools + XBRL companyfacts)

| Type | Name | Detection | Why it matters | Component |
|------|------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| E1 | New/rising AI language | AI terms in 10-K Business/MD&A sections; first-time (prior year zero) scores full weight, sharp YoY rise ~70%, sustained ~50% | Board/investors are asking; budget conversations start | intent |
| E2 | AI in risk factors only | AI terms appear ONLY in Item 1A | Aware but defensive — classic laggard marker, consultation angle | intent |
| E3 | Leadership change ≤12mo | 8-K Item 5.02 appointment language + C-level titles | New execs buy new capabilities in their first year | timing |
| E4 | Restructuring / cost program | 8-K Item 2.05 or cost-program phrases | Efficiency mandate → automation/agents ROI pitch | timing |
| E5 | GTM inefficiency | XBRL: S&M (or SG&A) % of revenue rising ≥5% relatively while revenue growth <15% | Paying more for each dollar of growth → AI lead-gen/outreach pitch | commercial_fit |
| E6 | No tech leadership | Latest DEF 14A names no CTO/CIO/CDO-type officer | Nobody inside owns AI → needs outside partner | capability_gap |
| E7 | Recent IPO ≤24mo | 424B4 / S-1 / 8-A12B filed within window | Building GTM + reporting muscle from scratch | timing |
| E8 | Sector peer laggard | Derived at scoring time: no AI language while ≥40% of enriched sector peers show AI signals | Competitive-pressure angle; peers acting while they don't = capability gap | capability_gap |
| E9 | Cash capacity | XBRL cash & equivalents ≥ $10M | Can actually afford a services engagement | commercial_fit |

## Parallel signals (paid — web research, one structured task per company)

| Type | Name | Detection | Why it matters | Component |
|------|------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| P1 | AI job postings | Open AI/ML/data-science roles | Investing in AI (adopter marker) — often still buys specialists | commercial_fit |
| P2 | GTM hiring | SDR/BDR/demand-gen/marketing openings | Scaling outbound the expensive way → outreach services pitch | commercial_fit |
| P3 | AI announcements | Press releases/news on AI initiatives ≤18mo | Proven budget + appetite (adopter marker) | intent |
| P4 | Product AI gap | No AI in product while direct competitors ship it | Falling behind → custom agents / implementation pitch | capability_gap |
| P5 | Martech stack | Evidence of marketing/sales tooling maturity | Low maturity → marketing automation opportunity | commercial_fit |
| P6 | Exec AI commentary | Earnings-call/interview quotes about AI | Direct voice-of-buyer evidence; great for personalization later | intent |

## Profile classification

- **laggard** — intent without execution: E1/E2/E8 present, P1/P3 absent. Lead: consultation/implementation.
- **adopter** — execution visible: P1 and/or P3 present. Lead: specialist services (lead-gen, outreach, custom agents).
- **hybrid** — intent + early scattered execution. **unclear** — weak evidence.

## Scoring

`total = intent(≤30) + capability_gap(≤25) + timing(≤25) + commercial_fit(≤20)`

Deterministic base score = capped sum of signal weights per component. The LLM
scorer (Haiku subagent) sees the base math and may deviate with justification.
Qualify: `total ≥ 65` AND ≥1 hard signal. Disqualify: `total < 45`. Between:
stays `scored` — human review band. All thresholds in `config/settings.yaml`.

**One recency story**: dated signals decay via `scoring.recency`
(full weight ≤ `full_days`, linear to `floor` × weight at the window edge);
each packet carries `timing_ceiling` = round(decayed base timing) +
`scoring.timing_ceiling_headroom` (default 8), and `score --commit` clamps the
LLM's timing component to it. Timing can never be manufactured from undated
evidence.

### Stacking bonus and urgency metadata (v3)

Two additions ride on scoring, one in the math and one outside it:

- **Stacking bonus** (`scoring.stacking` → `min_components`, `bonus`): when a
  company's signals span ≥ `min_components` distinct components (default 3 of
  intent/capability_gap/timing/commercial_fit), `bonus` points (default 5) are
  added to the **deterministic base score only** — never to the LLM verdict.
  Evidence stacked across components is a stronger buying signal than the same
  weight piled into one. The bonus also feeds the priority composite computed
  at `score --commit`.
- **Urgency metadata** (`scoring.urgency.windows` → `hot`, `warm`): every
  packet signal carries an `urgency` bucket from its `age_days` — `hot`
  (≤30d), `warm` (≤90d), `cold` (older), `null` when undated. Packet metadata
  only: informational context for the scorer and outreach SLAs downstream —
  it never changes the score math (recency already decays `effective_weight`
  separately, via `scoring.recency`).

## Outreach angles (v2)

Angles are dated, structured outreach events stored in the `angles` table —
separate from signals (signals feed scoring; angles feed outreach copy). One
row per event, deduped by fingerprint, never bulk-wiped. Freshness windows and
strength decay: `config/settings.yaml` → `angles`.

| Family | Sources | Typed fields | Copy angle |
|--------|---------|--------------|------------|
| funding | 8-K 3.02/1.01, S-3, 424B (EDGAR); news color (Parallel) | amount_usd, instrument, announced, use_of_proceeds, filing_type | "You just raised — deploy it on growth efficiently" |
| leadership | deep Parallel | role, person_name, start_date, first_in_role, mandate_quote | "New exec's first-100-days agenda" |
| ai_move | deep Parallel | initiative, move_type, partner, exec_quote, announced | "You're investing in AI — accelerate with specialists" |

**Qualify gate (v2)**: total ≥ 65 AND ≥1 hard signal AND ≥1 active (fresh)
angle. Blocked companies stay in the review band with `gate_reason:
no_active_angle` on the score row. Toggle: `scoring.require_angle`.
